          Trunk based development
          <blockquote>
            A source-control branching model, where developers collaborate on
            code in a single branch called ‘trunk’ *, resist any pressure to
            create other long-lived development branches by employing documented
            techniques. They therefore avoid merge hell, do not break the build,
            and live happily ever after.

          <blockquote>
            Trunk based development is about getting rid of the mindset that
            only "finished" and "fully working" code should be committed into
            master. This is never the case.

          <blockquote>
            The mindset that this model offers instead is that each commit must
            NOT be a breaking change. The key is to be making small atomic
            changes, which don't break CI and your functionality at runtime.

          <blockquote>
            Trunk based development doesn't have to mean everybody pushing to
            master without any code reviews. What it means is that instead of
            making multiple small commits into your feature branch, you make
            pull requests for those same commits to master instead.
